# React Digital Business Card

## Project Description

React Digital Business Card is a basic digital business card template created with React. The card includes a header section with links to social media profiles and a professional portrait. Additionally, there is an "About" section that provides a brief overview of yourself and an "Interests" section. This project was inspired by a Scrimba project of the same name and served as an opportunity to apply new React concepts.

I used Netlify to deploy the app and MaterialUI for the icons used.
